# Soundload

The goal of this project will be to create a utility that can download a file from a remote source, and dynamically play sound effects depending on the current download speed and size of the file. It will be written in Java and likely use the Swing GUI framework. UH Manoa's EZ graphics library will be used to order to assist with the graphics and sound effects; link to the project [here](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~dylank/ics111/).
